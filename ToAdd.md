A list of things I'm working on, mainly for myself to keep track of ideas and such.
*This list isn't organized, and some stuff on here are just loose ideas that may be scrapped or impossible to add*

* Entry description formatting
	- Colored Text (Including different colours per module)
	- Referencing Text
	    - Text that works like a quick link, it'll take you to another entry or page
* Built in sprite loader
* Ability to make custom unlock logic, without accessing the bestiaries code
	- Since I want to avoid having the bestiary a dependency, this is to hopefully allow users to use unlock logic outside of the automated ones, and allow them to make fully custom logic, without accessing the bestiaries code.
* Different bestiary save per save slot
* Make entries not just categorized in tabs, but also sub categories (don't worry I wont be adding extra menus)
* Clearer documentation on how to add your own entries through JSON files

#

* Resource manager should creatures tabs based on folder and / or JSON files, not just folders
