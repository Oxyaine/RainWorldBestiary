# Introduction
## Entries Adding Methods
Entries can be made in two ways, through code, and through JSON files placed in your mod.
- While adding entries through code is possible, it's not fully supported, and it's recommended you add entries through JSON files. Adding entries through code does give slightly more customization, such as setting a custom unlock condition, and custom module unlock conditions.
	- There are ways to add custom code to the bestiary without making the bestiary a dependency, you can read a bit more on that [here]().

- Using JSON Files gives you slightly less control, but is fully supported, and gives some advantages such as the bestiary managing the loading and unloading of your entries. It will also make your entries optional, meaning if the Bestiary is installed, your entries will be visible, otherwise if the Bestiary is not installed, they will remain hidden and unused.
