A list of things I'm working on, mainly for myself to keep track of ideas and such.

* Entry description formatting
	- Module Data (Such as titles and colors)
* Built in sprite loader
	- Convert all FSprites to menu illustrations, so no pre loading is required
* Ability to make custom unlock logic, without accessing the bestiaries code
* Ability to register manual unlock tokens, without accessing the bestiaries code
* Improved README.md

A list of bugs n stuff, that don't warrant an issue request on github.
