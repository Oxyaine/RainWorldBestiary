A list of things I'm working on, mainly for myself to keep track of ideas and such.

* Entry description formatting
	- Module Data (Such as titles and colors)
* Built in sprite loader
	- Convert all FSprites to menu illustrations, so no pre loading is required
* Improved README.md
* Ability to make custom unlock logic, without accessing the bestiaries code
    - Add Custom DLL Loading
	    * For Custom Bestiary Behaviour Without Making Bestiary Dependency
