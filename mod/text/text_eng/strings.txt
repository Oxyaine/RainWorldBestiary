BESTIARY_BATFLY_LOCKTEXT|A passive, flying, insectoid creature, that serve as a good source of food.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_BASIC_INTRODUCTION|Batflies are passive, flying, insectoid creatures that act as one of Slugcat's primary food sources. They are one of the most common creatures in the game, appearing in almost every region.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_APPEARANCE|Batflies are small black insects with two wings, antennae, and white eyes. They have no variation.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_1|Batflies can be caught and eaten to fill 1 food pip.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_2|Batflies are wary of <ref="Slugcats"=Rain World\The Survivor>, but are usually slow in their evasion. They can be caught easily by jumping towards fast enough and catching them.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_3|Catching Batflies may be easier from above, as they often stop and hover in place. Rocks and Spears can also be used to kill Batflies from afar. 
BESTIARY_BATFLY_BATNIP|Batnip attracts Batflies, which makes them easier to catch. Unlike other food sources, Batflies do not persist in shelters, and are either auto-consumed or deleted.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_UTILITY_1|Batflies can be used to distract certain creatures
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_POLE_MIMIC|, such as <ref="Pole Mimics"=Rain World\creaturetype-PoleMimic>
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_KELP|, <ref="Monster Kelp"=Rain World\creaturetype-TentaclePlant>, etc
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_UTILITY_2|. When thrown in range, these creatures may prioritize the Batfly over Slugcat, retreating into their dens to consume them.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_CICADA|Batflies can also be used to raise reputation with <ref="Squidcada"=Rain World\creaturetype-CicadaA>.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HIDING_1|The white-tipped plants that Batflies nest in also act as Batfly hiding spots. When a threat gets too close to a Batfly, they may dive and burrow into these plants.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_STACKING_1|Batflies can hang upside down from ceilings, poles, and even each other, forming stacks. If a Batfly with others attached to it from below starts flying, the attached Batflies may not separate, and they can end up struggling to fly.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_STACKING_2| If Slugcat grabs a Batfly attached to a chain, the entire chain is picked up until the other Batflies fly away. This can result in strange physics if the Batflies are still attached to the ceiling.

BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_LOCKTEXT|A large, slow, chunky lizard that charges its prey and is unable to climb.
BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_BASIC_INTRODUCTION|Green Lizards are a common species of Lizard. They are one of the first Lizards the player may encounter and can be found throughout many regions.
BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_APPEARANCE_1|Green Lizards come in various shades of green, ranging from lime to mint. They have black bodies which usually feature short, stubby spikes or are otherwise plain.

BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_APPEARANCE_3|Unique to their species are their rectangular heads with horns that curl downwards, as well as their curved teeth.
BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_KILLED|Fighting Green Lizards can be fairly easy on level ground, though their high health means they can take 5-10 Spear hits to kill.
BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_STUNNED|A hit to the face with a Rock can stun and flip them over, leaving their soft body vulnerable to Spears.
BESTIARY_GREENLIZARD_IMPALED|After 3 Spear hits, they typically attempt to retreat to their den. They are slow, making it hard for them to flee and thus leaving them open to further attack.
