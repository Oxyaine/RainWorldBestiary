BESTIARY_BATFLY_LOCKTEXT|A passive, flying, insectoid creature, that serve as a good source of food.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_BASIC_INTRODUCTION|Batflies are passive, flying, insectoid creatures that act as one of Slugcat's primary food sources. They are one of the most common creatures in the game, appearing in almost every region.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_APPEARANCE|Batflies are small black insects with two wings, antennae, and white eyes. They have no variation.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_1|Batflies can be caught and eaten to fill 1 food pip.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_2|Batflies are wary of <ref="Slugcats"=Rain World\The Survivor>, but are usually slow in their evasion. They can be caught easily by jumping towards fast enough and catching them.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HUNTING_3|Catching Batflies may be easier from above, as they often stop and hover in place. Rocks and Spears can also be used to kill Batflies from afar. 
BESTIARY_BATFLY_BATNIP|Batnip attracts Batflies, which makes them easier to catch. Unlike other food sources, Batflies do not persist in shelters, and are either auto-consumed or deleted.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_UTILITY_1|Batflies can be used to distract certain creatures
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_POLE_MIMIC|, such as <ref="Pole Mimics"=Rain World\creaturetype-PoleMimic>
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_KELP|, <ref="Monster Kelp"=Rain World\creaturetype-TentaclePlant>, etc
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_UTILITY_2|. When thrown in range, these creatures may prioritize the Batfly over Slugcat, retreating into their dens to consume them.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_UTILITY_CICADA|Batflies can also be used to raise reputation with <ref="Squidcada"=Rain World\creaturetype-CicadaA>.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_MIGRATING_1|Batflies can be found in 'hives' around the world, These rooms feature black, white-tipped plants. Every cycle, Batflies attempt to migrate to a new swarm room.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_MIGRATING_2| Depending on how many Batflies Slugcat has killed, multiple Batfly hives may be empty. When a hive is empty, the plants lose their white tips.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_HIDING_1|The white-tipped plants that Batflies nest in also act as Batfly hiding spots. When a threat gets too close to a Batfly, they may dive and burrow into these plants.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_STACKING_1|Batflies can hang upside down from ceilings, poles, and even each other, forming stacks. If a Batfly with others attached to it from below starts flying, the attached Batflies may not separate, and they can end up struggling to fly.
BESTIARY_BATFLY_STACKING_2| If Slugcat grabs a Batfly attached to a chain, the entire chain is picked up until the other Batflies fly away. This can result in strange physics if the Batflies are still attached to the ceiling.
