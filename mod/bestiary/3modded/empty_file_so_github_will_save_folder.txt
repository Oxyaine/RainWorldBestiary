An empty file, so that github will save the `3modded` folder, since it refuses to do so if the folder is empty, however the resource manager wont load the tab if the folder doesn't exist.
This file is ignored by the resource manager, since its in the location of where entries should be, yet its an .txt file, resource manager only looks for .json files :)
