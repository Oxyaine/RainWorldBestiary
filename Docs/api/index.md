# Welcome to the SlugBase API docs!
These are intended to help mod authors implement custom features. See the [Releases](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBaseRemix/releases/latest) page on GitHub for examples and binaries to reference.

Slugcat and world features can be accessed through [SlugBase.Features.PlayerFeatures](SlugBase.Features.PlayerFeatures.yml) and [SlugBase.Features.GameFeatures](SlugBase.Features.GameFeatures.yml), respectively.
