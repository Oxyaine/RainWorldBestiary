# Welcome to the SlugBase docs!
This site is intended to help developers add even more slugcats to Rain World. If you just want to play slugcat mods, head over to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/312520/workshop/). SlugBase will be automatically downloaded if any mods require it.

To get started, check out [Getting Started](articles/gettingstarted.md).
