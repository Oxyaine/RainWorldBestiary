### Issue - Auto Generated Title
***The issue is only present when the toggle *Minimize Title Character Spacing*, in experimental tab of the remix menu, is enabled.***

The auto generated titles look a little off, The spacing between the letters is weird and inconsistent, I'm not sure why this happens, I've tested my code other places and it seems to work, just something about the way the game draws sprites throws off some of the spacing and makes the characters wonky. I've countered this a bit with some extra code, so it's harder to notice the offsets, but it's still not perfect. I will continue working on solutions, but currently, this is an issue.
