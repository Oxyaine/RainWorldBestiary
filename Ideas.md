A list of things I'm working on, mainly for myself to keep track of ideas and such.
*This list isn't organized, and some stuff on here are just loose ideas that may be scrapped or impossible to add*

* Entry description formatting
	- Colored Text
	- Module Data (Such as titles and colors)
	- <strike>Referencing Text
	    - Text that works like a quick link, it'll take you to another entry or page</strike>
* Built in sprite loader
	- Convert all FSprites to menu illustrations, so no loading is required
* Ability to make custom unlock logic, without accessing the bestiaries code
* Clearer Documentation
