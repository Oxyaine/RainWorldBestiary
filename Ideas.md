A list of things I'm working on, mainly for myself to keep track of ideas and such.
*This list isn't organized, and some stuff on here are just loose ideas that may be scrapped or impossible to add*

* Entry description formatting
	- Module Data (Such as titles and colors)
* Built in sprite loader
	- Convert all FSprites to menu illustrations, so no pre loading is required
* Ability to make custom unlock logic, without accessing the bestiaries code
* Ability to register manual unlock tokens, without accessing the bestiaries code
* Improved README.md
