# Rain World Bestiary
An in game bestiary that unlocks as you encounter creatures!

This file is here to help fellow developers add their own entries or entry categories to the bestiary.

# Quick Note
Whenever I change the code (in a way that would break dependent mods, for example renaming a variable / function / class, completely changing how a function runs, or changing the structure of how entries are saved), I'll try my best to leave the old code intact, but to mark it as obsolete, that way any updates I make will hopefuly not break dependent mods, but I will still be able to make drastic changes.

# First Things First
Everything in the mod (to do with managing and working with entries), is stored in the `Bestiary` class, so most things should just be accessible from there, however if something is missing, leave an issue request and I'll try to add it.
