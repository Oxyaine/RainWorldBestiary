# Rain World Bestiary
An in game bestiary that unlocks as you encounter creatures!

This file is here to help fellow developers add their own entries or entry categories to the bestiary.

# Quick Note
Whenever I change the code (in a way that would break dependent mods, for example renaming a variable / function / class, completely changing how a function runs, or changing the structure of how entries are saved), I'll try my best to leave the old code intact, but to mark it as obsolete, that way any updates I make will hopefuly not break dependent mods, but I will still be able to make drastic changes.

# First Things First
Everything in the mod to do with managing and working with entries, is stored in the `Bestiary` class, so if you'd like to add your own entires or tabs, this is where you should go.
